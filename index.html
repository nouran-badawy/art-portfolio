    <p>My name is Nouran Badawy and I'm a graphic design major at CSU East Bay. This is my very first website! I've never quite made a website before so this is incredibly new!</p>
      
    <p>A few things about me to get started! I love music, whether it's singing, listeing, playing, or making music. As I type this, I'm listening to a song titled "Maybe we're meant to be alone" by Bad Suns. I love art, and enjoy creating and looking at art. I'm not much of a STEM person, but I love astronomy and most subjects regarding science. My favorite season is the summer time, and my favorite colors are pastel colors. I enjoy reading, although I struggle to get into a new series and finish a book all within a few days or weeks. I also enjoy movies and tv shows! My current favorites are Gravity Falls and Bob's Burgers. They're comfort shows for me, I think.</p>
    
    <p>I'm a bit anxious about this semester, and I've had my struggles these past few weeks since the semester has started, but I think I'm doing alright. I think I'll be okay this semester.</p>
