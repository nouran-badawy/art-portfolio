    <h1>Om Ali - Egyptian Bread Pudding</h1>
      <p>Om Ali or Umm Ali is the Egyptian equivalent to the western bread pudding. A traditional Egyptian dessert of soaked bread, milk and loads of nuts.</p>
      <p>Omm Ali is sort of bread pudding. It can be made using phyllo dough, puff pastry or croissants. In most Egyptian pastry shops you can buy special Om Ali's dough to start with. I've made it today with puff pastry and find it quite successful. Om Ali is more of a winter dessert as it gives lots of energy to warm up with.</p>
