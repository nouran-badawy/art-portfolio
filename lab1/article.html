    <h1>For These Top Artists, Holograms Offer a New Dimension</h1>
    <h3>For “PST Art,” the Getty is showing works by John Baldessari, Louise Bourgeois, Deana Lawson and others in a medium that promised to be the future.</h3>

    <p>A little company called Holographic Images invited some blue-chip artists down to Miami 30 years ago. They were wined and dined and given ample time to hit the beach. They were also asked to make the art of the future. They made holograms.</p>

    <p>Holograms are strange, ghostly, 3-D images on glass or film. Until then, Holographic Images had mostly been producing the kind of garish, color holograms you might pick up in a poster shop. But the C-Project, as this new venture was called (“C” being the symbol for the speed of light), was going to elevate the medium. Or so the company hoped.</p>

    <p>Funded by two of America’s leading art collectors — the Detroit real estate magnate Guy Barron and his wife, Nora, a longtime social worker — the C-Project ran for five years and managed to recruit 20 of the art world’s biggest stars to work in an esoteric medium that some thought cheesy. John Baldessari. Louise Bourgeois. Chuck Close. Roy Lichtenstein. Dorothea Rockburne. Ed Ruscha. James Turrell. Now the work that six of these 20 artists made is at the center of an exhibition that suggests just how significant holographic art has become. The show, called “Sculpting With Light: Contemporary Artists and Holography,” opens Aug. 20 at the Getty Museum in Los Angeles.</p>

    <p>The show is an early entry in “PST Art: Art &amp; Science Collide,” a seven-month series of exhibitions throughout Southern California that’s supported by $20.4 million in funding from the Getty. It includes early-stage, preparatory versions of holograms by Baldessari, Rockburne and Ann McCoy as well as fully realized holograms by Bourgeois, Close and Ruscha. Also featured are works by two artists who are making holograms now — Deana Lawson, the Los Angeles artist celebrated for her intimate photo-portraits of Black Americans, and Matthew Schreiber.</p>

        <figcaption>“The math behind a torus was very interesting to her,” the artist Matthew Schreiber said of Deana Lawson, whose hologram “Torus” is seen above. “She started talking about the idea of the hologram as a talisman, like a shard of dark crystal — this magical, optical object.”<br>Credit...Deana Lawson/Gagosian Gallery, via The J.

    <p>Without Schreiber, none of this would have happened. He’d worked at Holographic Images after getting a B.F.A. from the University of Florida, and then left to study holography at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago and the Royal College of Art in London. When he returned to Miami for the C-Project, his job was to become fully versed in each artist’s work, and to then guide them through the painstaking process of creation. Now 57, he continues to make holograms for himself and with others, Lawson included. “A lot of my work has to do with spectacle and novelty,” he said in a recent interview — key issues in any consideration of kitsch.</p>

    <p>Holography has been dogged by accusations of tackiness from the start. The medium was still nascent in 1975 when Hilton Kramer, the chief art critic for The New York Times and a resolute guardian of high culture, slammed an early holography exhibition at the International Center of Photography. “The aesthetic naiveté of this show must really be seen to be believed,” Kramer declared. “Perhaps some genius is waiting in the wings to make something memorable of this combination of peep‐show realism and jukebox color, but he is nowhere in evidence here.”</p>

    <p>It’s not the first time a new medium has been met with a mix of condescension and wonderment. In the 1840s and 1850s, when photography was new, people called it “the mirror with a memory.” Holograms are “windows with memories,” Virginia Heckert, curator of photographs at the Getty, said, as we sat in a wood-paneled study room in the museum’s West Los Angeles acropolis, looking at an eerily well-defined self-portrait by Close.</p>
    <p>In early photo portraits, the subject seems to be staring back at you; in holograms, it’s as if you see the subject through glass. “They are absolutely three-dimensional, and they are not static,” Heckert said. “As you change your position, you see different things outside that window.” And because they can be seen only when lit by a laser or by highly focused incandescent light, she added, it’s as if “light actually sculpts the object into being.”</p>

    <p>Holography is a highly technical medium that captures interference patterns in light waves with great precision, yet yields a result that appears strangely insubstantial. This is because a hologram, unlike a photo, is not, technically speaking, an image. It is a pattern of information that, as Schreiber has put it, contains the “whole message” of whatever is being recorded, much as our DNA contains all the data that gives rise to a human body. The word itself stems from the Greek “holos,” meaning whole, and “gramma,” or message. A single cell contains the entirety of our DNA; each slice of a hologram, no matter how small, contains all the information that’s in the whole.</p>
    <p>Many things that are touted as holograms — the revivified Tupac Shakur that performed with Snoop Dogg and Dr. Dre at Coachella in 2012, for example — are not holograms at all but variants on a 19th-century illusion. Making a hologram is considerably more complex. It requires capturing the interference pattern that’s formed when a laser beam aimed at a glass plate or a special film intersects another laser beam that has been reflected off the object you want to portray. This interference pattern is recorded, creating the spatial illusion that is a hologram. Extreme care must be taken to make sure the apparatus remains absolutely still. Schreiber has recorded a video for the Getty to detail how it works, but even he finds the process hard to articulate. “For years and years and years I have tried to come up with like, super easy ways to describe it, but it still blows my mind totally,” he said. So now, he added, “I allow it to be magical.”</p>
