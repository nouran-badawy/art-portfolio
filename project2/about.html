            <h2>PSA Statement</h2>
            <p>Racial discrimination, also known as racism, is a form of prejudice against another person because of their race, ancestry, ethnic or national origin, and/or their skin color. It impacts our lives, our communities, and our society as a whole. It has created a world and a system that doesn’t allow for equal opportunity to certain people, purely because of the color of their skin. It has created division between us as human beings, and caused emotional, mental, and physical distress to those affected by it most.</p>
            <p>Everyone deserves respect and equal opportunity in this world, regardless of race or ethnicity. We, as human beings, must speak out and stand for racial justice. By educating ourselves, speaking out against bias, and embracing our diversity, we can all work to dismantle the harmful stereotypes that allow for discrimination to fester. Support organizations fighting for racial justice, listen and be an ally within your community, and speak out against discrimination when you see it.</p>
            <p>Be the change you want to see in the world. Even the smallest actions make a difference. Listen, learn, pay attention, and advocate for change that allows for racial equality. We only have one planet, and we’re all stuck on it together. There’s no reason to be so divisive, when we can instead fight for a more inclusive, fair society where everyone is equal, valued, and celebrated for who they are. Stand with your community against racial discrimination, and fight for a stronger, more unified future for yourself, for your community, and for our society.</p>
            <h2>Why did I choose this topic?</h2>
            <p>Racial Discrimination is a topic that hits very close to home for me. I grew up in a white dominated area, and experienced a lot of racial discrimination as I got older. Even now, as I'm out of that area, I am aware of the societal expectations put upon me as a person of color. I see it everyday in the way people look at me, in the way I'm outcasted in different groups of people, in the way people see me and my family when we're all out together, and in the way the world sees my people and other people of color. I've known from a young age that this world was not made for me and was instead made for a particular group of people that I could never be nor do I wish to be. It hurts that there are spaces in which I'm not accepted, but I find hope in the people I create connections with, and the people that fight for people like me. It's difficult to encompass years of systemic racism into one website, especially when there are so many complex layers to the subject, but I hope I was able to provide an understanding of the issue to my audience at least.</p>
            <h2>My Design Choices</h2>
            <p>The design choices I made came from a place of simplicity. I thought it would be best to make the message of this PSA the focus point while making the website easy to read and navigate. I believed a minimal color palette would suit this approach best. Black and white and only using a light red to highlight the important sections of the website seemed like the best idea to get my message across. I also felt that breaking up sections with multiple paragraphs using the images was a good idea for visibility too. Keeping the image on the right and the text on the left in one section but having the next section have the image on the left and the text on the right seemed like a visually appealing idea.</p>
            <p>Below are some of the Usability Principles I used:
              <ul>
              <li>Creating effective visual hierarchies</li>
              <li>Persistent navigation</li>
              <li>Made obvious what was clickable by making my nav turn a different color once hovering over it</li>
              </ul>
