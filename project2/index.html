            <h2>Understanding Racial Discrimination</h2>
            <p>Racial discrimination, also known as racism, is a form of prejudice against another person because of their race, ancestry, ethnic or national origin, and/or their skin color. It can manifest in overt forms, such as hate speech, hate crimes, and violence, as well as in subtle ways, like implicit biases or microaggressions. Historically, systemic racism has been embedded in laws, policies, and societal norms and it creates inequities in areas like education, employment, healthcare, and housing. The first step toward addressing these deeply rooted prejudices and continuing to shape our world positively moving forward is to recognize these patterns, make the effort to educate ourselves, and be the change we want to see in the world.</p>

            <h2>The Impact on Individuals and Communities</h2>
            <p>Racial discrimination has extreme effects on individual people and entire communities. For individuals on a personal level, it can lead to emotional distress, loss of opportunities, and long-term psychological harm, such as anxiety and depression. For entire communities dealing with racial discrimination, these communities often deal with economic inequality, health inequities, and a reduced access to resources, all of which perpetuate cycles of trauma and disadvantage.</p>

            <p>For example, historically, Black people in America have been racially discriminated against for years, even up until now in 2024. While slavery and segregation have ended and laws have been put in place to prevent those systems of abuse, it doesn’t change the fact that many institutions in America were created upon the foundation of anti-Black sentiment, and therefore, continue to carry out that same sentiment whether it’s intentional or not. According to Pew Research Center’s article titled “Racial Discrimination shapes how Black Americans view their progress and U.S. institutions”, they state “Most Black adults say they have experienced racial discrimination (75%), either regularly (13%) or from time to time (62%). They say these experiences make them feel like the system is set up for their failure. Many also say Black people must work harder than everyone else to achieve success”. This racial discrimination shows up everywhere for Black people, whether it’s in the form of police brutality, lack of proper healthcare, disregard of proper education, issues with housing, or lack of opportunities in the job market. It's heavily engrained in American history and society, and allows for a system that's not made for Black people.</p>

              <p>Another example could be attributed to Islamophobia and racism against Arab Americans. As a Muslim Arab American, I, and my family, have dealt with racism for as long as we have lived in America. Being made fun of because of my background, or being targeted as a terrorist by the public is frightening and jarring to me, my family, and all other Muslim Arab Americans. There have been many events within our history that’s led to these spikes, such as the September 11 attacks in 2001, the 2016 presidential win of Donald Trump’s campaign and his integration into office, and even now with the ongoing Palestinian genocide that’s facilitated by American taxpayer money. According to The Marshall Project’s article titled “Hate Crimes Rose in 2022 - and Concerns Remain High”, they state that “The number of hate crimes against Muslims has never returned to pre-9/11 levels.</p>

            <p>By 2011, a decade after the 9/11 attack, police departments recorded 162 anti-Muslim hate crimes across the U.S., more than five times the number prior to 2001”. This shows the impact of 9/11 and how much it affected Muslims and Arab Americans up until this point in 2024. These charts to the right also show the increase in hate crimes with the Donald Trump campaign in 2016. After promising to ban travel and immigration from seven specific Arab and Islamic countries, an uproar of hate crimes ensued, targeting innocent Muslims and Arab Americans. His words labeled an entire population as terrorists, and allowed for hateful speech and actions to occur against us. With every conflict regarding Muslim Americans and/or Arab Americans, a spike of hate crimes and racism occurs, and makes life especially difficult for this particular population of people.</p>

            <p>Race is a social construct, not a genetic trait. It is simply something humans, more specifically, white people, have created as a form of categorizing people into a particular box and oppressing them. Because of the unfortunate system of oppression we live in, people from all sorts of backgrounds are constantly dealing with systemic oppression of America and our world as a whole. According to another article from Pew Research Center titled “Race in America 2019”, they state that “About three-quarters of blacks and Asians (76% of each) – and 58% of Hispanics – say they have experienced discrimination or have been treated unfairly because of their race or ethnicity at least from time to time.</p>

            <p>In contrast, about two-thirds of whites (67%) say they’ve never experienced this.” The graph on the right also illustrates the different forms of racism that people of varying backgrounds have experienced in comparison to white people, who have the privilege of not dealing with those same issues. It’s difficult to encompass everyone’s struggles into one website, especially considering how deeply rooted this issue is in our society and our everyday lives. But learning about and acknowledging the issue of racial discrimination and how prominent it is in our world is important. This PSA is meant to bring light to the issue, and in turn, allow you to make the decision to educate yourself further.</p>

            <h2>Recognizing and Addressing Bias</h2>
            <p>One of the most effective ways of recognizing and fighting against racial discrimination is by addressing bias, both in ourselves and in our overall society. Implicit biases, for instance, are unconscious attitudes or stereotypes and can influence our actions and decisions without us even realizing it. Acknowledging these biases and actively making the efforts to challenge them can foster a more inclusive environment as well as more equitable behavior. Another way to fight against racial discrimination would be to encourage open and respectful conversations that could help break down prejudices and promote understanding. We must learn to listen to one another and have hard conversations about the truth of the world we live in. Educate yourselves and others around you, and take the time to acknowledge your place in the world and the power you hold as an individual. This will eventually pave the way for meaningful changes in ourselves as individuals and our society as a whole.</p>

            <h2>Advocating For Change</h2>
            <p>To tackle the issue of racial discrimination, we must come together as people and advocate for systemic change. We must support policies and legislations that promote equality and hold institutions and systems such as, for instance, the legal system, educational system, and the housing system, accountable for their actions. Equally important is the role of individuals who choose to speak out against the injustice that they witness in front of them and act as allies with marginalized groups. To advocate is to not only fight against racism but also create an inclusive society where everyone has equal opportunities.</p>

            <h2>Resources and Hope</h2>
            <p>In the fight against racial discrimination, access to resources and support is crucial to making a difference. Victims of discrimination can benefit from organizations and hotlines that provide legal assistance, counseling, and advocacy. Educational tools, such as books, workshops, and documentaries, help to raise awareness and allow for better understanding. To envision a world where equity and solidarity prevail reinforces how important collective action amongst us all is. Together, we can dismantle racism within ourselves and our society and build a more inclusive and just society.</p>
