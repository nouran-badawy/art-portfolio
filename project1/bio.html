            <h3>Life and Education</h3>
            <p>Barbara Kruger is a well known artist and designer born in 1945 in Newark, New Jersey. In her years of education, she briefly attended Syracuse University. Shortly after, she attended the School of Visual Arts, where she studied art under Marvin Israel and Diane Arbus in Parsons School of Design in NYC.</p>
            <h3>Early Career</h3>  
            <p>At the beginning of her career, Kruger started working at Cond√© Nast Publications for the Mademoiselle magazine and very quickly became their head designer. Later, she worked as a graphic designer, art director, and picture editor in the department of the arts for different publications such as House and Garden, Aperture, and many others. Eventually, Kruger started showing her artwork in galleries in the 1970's in New York. Although, in 1976, Kruger felt that her art had no meaning and decided to quit making art for a year. During this time, she took several different teaching positions. </p>

            <h3>Her Signature Style</h3>
            <p>In 1977, Kruger began making art again after initally quitting. She decided to move away from her earlier styles and explored a style regarding photo and text collages. Eventually, her signature style developed in 1979. Her pieces are usually repurposed, large-scale, black and white, found images overlaid with text. She typically contrasts these images with a short and sweet phrase either in a Futura Bold or Helvetica Extra Bold Typeface in black, white, or red text bars. Phrases in her works often include pronouns, and are often meant to address cultural constructions of power, identity, consumerism, and sexuality. Kruger makes it a point to bring the audience into her pieces, and make them interrogate their own positions in the world. She wants her audience to question and change the system around themselves and demands we consider how our identities are formed within our culture through the representation of language and image. Her pieces challenge the viewer to think of society and the issues the system creates for us such as issues regarding feminism, classicism, and consumerism, and uses a style that is inspired by the very magazines that sell these ideas.
            <h3>More About Her Work</h3>
            <p>Aside from her art, Kruger has also produced video and audio works, written criticisms, taught classes, curated exhibitions, and developed public projects such as billboards, bus wraps, and architectural interventions. She has also taught at the California Institute of Art, the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, and the University of Berkeley. She currently lives in New York and Los Angeles</p>
