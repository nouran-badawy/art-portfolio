              <p>Hello and welcome to my portfolio! I'm Nouran Badawy, a 22-year-old graphic design student at Cal State East Bay. I find joy in taking on a new challenge, and turning an idea into something thrilling and exciting for others to look at.</p>
            
              <p>My educational journey has provided me with a strong foundation in digital media, typography, and design principles. Art has also had a profound impact on me personally as well, and I find that I've grown and changed positively as a person because of it. With each day, I'm constantly looking for new ways to improve myself and my work, and become a better artist, person, and designer.</p>
                
              <p>This website will contain information about me, as well as a portfolio of my own work. This website itself is my own personal project as well, as I created it myself from scratch using HTML code. In a way, this website is also considered a part of my portfolio, and I hope it, along with the rest of my work, showcases my skills and potential as a designer.</p>
      
              <p>A few things about me before you begin browsing my work to further understand who I am! I've always had a creative mind, and found joy in expressing myself creatively in various ways. For instance, I love expressing myself musically! I'm always searching for new music to listen to, and I enjoy singing and making my own music in my free time. I play violin, ukulele, and the guitar, and hope to one day learn the piano. I also enjoy expressing myself through fashion! Aside from the arts, I love astronomy and most subjects regarding science. My favorite season is the summer time, and my favorite colors are pastel colors. I enjoy reading, although I struggle to get into a new series and finish a book all within a few days or weeks. I also enjoy movies and all sorts of different tv shows!</p>
    
              <p>Thank you for stopping by, and please feel free to browse through my work! I hope to continue showcasing new work in the future as I continue my journey!</p>
